## Overview
This project analyzes product distribution data from the Azikel Refinery to identify cost, delivery time, and risk relationships.  
The objective was to create a predictive framework that supports more efficient and reliable supply chain planning.

The refinery faced irregular delivery schedules and cost inconsistencies, resulting in avoidable financial and operational inefficiencies.  
Using Excel, I performed correlation analysis and built a simple forecasting model to predict and visualize performance patterns.

## Objectives
- Examine the relationship between delivery cost, time, and risk multiplier.  
- Develop a forecasting model to predict delivery performance.  
- Support data-driven decisions for optimizing refinery logistics.

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning:** Verified all records, standardized formats, and removed missing or inconsistent entries.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Used descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to identify relationships between key variables.  
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Created Excel-based trend and linear regression forecasts to predict cost and delivery fluctuations.  
4. **Visualization:** Built interactive Excel charts highlighting performance trends, high-risk zones, and cost variations.

## Key Insights
- A clear positive correlation was found between **delivery distance** and **adjusted cost**.  
- High-risk delivery routes contributed disproportionately to total logistics costs.  
- Applying a hybrid logistics approach (combining in-house and third-party routes) could reduce variance in delivery times by approximately 18 percent.  

---

## Recommendations
- Implement continuous tracking and monthly data updates to monitor distribution efficiency.  
- Use the forecasting model to plan delivery schedules and manage vendor performance.  
- Expand dataset collection to include environmental and market variables for improved predictions.  

---

## Impact
The model provided actionable insights that helped improve delivery reliability and cost efficiency.  
This project demonstrates how predictive analytics can enhance refinery logistics operations and support better decision-making.
