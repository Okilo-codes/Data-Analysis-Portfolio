## Featured Projects

### 1. Azikel Refinery – Predictive Analysis for Product Distribution Optimization
**Tools:** Excel, Statistical Analysis, Trend Forecasting

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on predicting product distribution efficiency for the Azikel Refinery by analyzing cost, delivery time, and risk multiplier data.  
The goal was to build a predictive framework that supports supply chain and logistics optimization in refinery operations.

**Key Insights:**  
- Identified correlation between delivery distance, adjusted cost, and risk multiplier.  
- Developed a forecasting model to predict potential delivery delays.  
- Proposed a Hybrid Logistics Model, which reduced projected delivery variance by 18 percent.  
- Recommended strategic cost control and route optimization measures.

**Impact:**  
Improved the refinery’s data-driven logistics planning process, leading to more stable delivery performance and reduced distribution risks.

### 2. HSE Department Revenue Analysis – Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OFGZA)
**Tools:** Excel, Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization

**Overview:**  
This analysis examines the revenue performance of the Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Department of the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OFGZA) between 2020 and 2023.  
It addresses major data management gaps, revenue inconsistencies, and declining compliance rates among registered enterprises.

**Objectives:**  
- Develop a clean and reliable revenue database.  
- Compare projected versus actual revenue for key HSE activities.  
- Identify financial leakages and propose solutions for revenue optimization.

**Key Findings:**  
- Only 10 percent of the projected inspection revenue was collected.  
- Over $128,700 in potential income lost due to missing or incomplete records.  
- Compliance dropped sharply in 2023 despite improvement in 2022.  
- Identified top and least-performing enterprises for targeted engagement.

**Recommendations:**  
1. Create a centralized database of all enterprises and payment records.  
2. Automate payment reminders to improve compliance.  
3. Conduct monthly performance reviews and forecasting.  
4. Strengthen collaboration between HSE and data analysis units.

**Impact:**  
Uncovered over 62 percent of uncollected revenue and proposed a data-driven recovery framework that could increase annual income significantly through better record management and forecasting.
